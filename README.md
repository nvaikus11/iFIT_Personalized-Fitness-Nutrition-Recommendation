# iFIT: A GenAI-Powered Personalized Fitness and Nutrition Recommendation System

---

## 1. Executive Summary

iFIT is a next-generation personalized fitness and nutrition recommendation platform leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) and content-based filtering. It dynamically creates tailored workout routines and diet plans based on individual goals, preferences, and health constraints. iFIT empowers users to meet fitness targets efficiently through personalized experiences, real-time interactions, and continuous learning from feedback.

## 2. Problem Statement

Fitness apps often offer generic plans that fail to address individual lifestyles, goals, and health conditions. Nutrition and workout advice needs to be adaptive, responsive, and explainable. Users also struggle with maintaining motivation without interactive feedback. iFIT aims to close these gaps using GenAI to offer real-time customization, chat-based guidance, and engaging content generation.
